Jarvis is a data science toolbox compatible with Jupyter Notebook.

It is also released on Kaggle as a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/izgzhen/jarvis).
To use it in your Kaggle kernel, just import this dataset and start your code with

```
from shutil import copyfile
copyfile("../input/jarvis/jarvis.py", "./jarvis.py")
import jarvis as j
```
